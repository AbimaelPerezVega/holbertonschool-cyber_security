Project Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of cybersecurity knowledge, practical exercises, and tools to enhance security skills. It is structured into four main categories:

Cyber Security Basics – Introduction to cybersecurity concepts and cryptography.

Linux Security – Security fundamentals for Linux environments, including permissions, access control, and server security.

Network Security – Hands-on learning in reconnaissance techniques, host discovery, and traffic analysis.

Web Application Security – Covers OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, BurpSuite fundamentals, SQL injection, and more.

Story Behind the Project

Cybersecurity is a field that constantly evolves, and staying updated requires a mix of theory and hands-on practice. This repository is part of my projects for Holberton Coding School, where I am specializing in Cyber Security. Through these projects, I am gaining hands-on experience in ethical hacking, penetration testing, and defensive security practices.
